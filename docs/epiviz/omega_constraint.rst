.. _omega-constraint:

Omega Constraint
================

This constrains other-cause mortality using data
from mtother, which is the integrand for other-cause mortality.

The choice to use an omega constraint is set in EpiViz-AT,
and this is obeyed.

We have options for how to include the omega-constraint.

 *  Include all data from all years.
 *  Subset data to years where there are measured data.
 *  Thin the data by year so it is every five years.

Adding lots of omega-constraint data can slow the program.
