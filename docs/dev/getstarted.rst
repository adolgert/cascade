Get Started
===========

Dear Developer,

This code runs Dismod-AT within the IHME environment.
As a first step, consider the problem domain for
Dismod-AT so that you know terminology.

 * :ref:`global-model-draft`

 * :ref:`dismod-description`

Once you have that, maybe you want to see the scope
of what is installed and with which teams this development
effort communicates.

 * :ref:`cascade-architecture`

 * :ref:`map-of-the-code`

How do you install?

 * On your machine or under your account on the cluster:
   :ref:`install-api`.

 * For IHME, as infrastructure, :ref:`operations-and-maintenance`.
